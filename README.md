## Third part

The tool uses different services to get subdomains in different ways

The WAF detector was modified and addapted from [CRLFSuite](https://github.com/Nefcore/CRLFsuite) concept

All DNS queries are scripted in python at 100%

Email harvesting using Hunter.io API with personal token (free signup)
